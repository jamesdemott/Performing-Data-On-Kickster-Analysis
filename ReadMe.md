# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project and Purpose
Sometimes our passion projects are difficult to actualize. For our friend Louise, whose kickstarter for the play Fever, was one such instance. Lousie failed to secure her fundraising goal, coming short and was therefore unable to complete her project. Our purpose for this analysis was to understand if there was an element of Louise's approach (either by launching her project at a different time, or setting her funding goal differently) could increase the likelihood that her future endeavors could be more successful in meeting their goals and reaching fruition. 



## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Our initial analysis was to understand whether there was an obvious visual relationship between the launch date of a a theater kickstarter and its success. We see that generally successful kickstarters are far more likely (on a count basis) duding the spring and summer months, peaking with projects launched in May while the number of successful kickstarters launched in the fall and winter is far lower. This suggests that Louise would be behooved by launching and future kickstarters during the summer months. One conclusion based on launch date is that plays launched in the early spring or summer are more likely to be successful. Another conclusion based on launch date it that there are far fewer kickstarters launched in December, so this may be a good time to launch a project as there is simply less competition for individuals seeking to contribute to the arts. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Our analysis of outcomes based on goals is predicated on the idea that there may be an obvious visual relationship between the dollar amount set as a goal and the project's success in achieving funding. Our visual results suggest an interesting relationship between success of the kickstarter and the funding goal. Smaller projects (requesting less than $1,500) tend to be more likely successes than failures, while in the range of $20,000 to  $35,000 tend to fail have a higher ratio of failures. The trend is reversed in the $35,000 to $50,000 range where these plays tend to be successful and then drops off at the $50,000 range, which despite the low number of projects in this range do appear to be incredibly unsuccessful. Our conclusion based on goals can be that a funding amount should be either less than $20,000 or between $35,000 and $40,000 as these are the ranges in which the percentage of successes are greater than the percentage of failures. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The most difficult challenge I encountered during this analysis was not establishing the goal ranges on an inclusive basis. By neglecting to include "<=" in my excel formulas I was initially dropping important data points, which made the graph incomprehensible. The lesson learned is to make sure that there are no data points "falling through the cracks". In a less contrived situation I will be sure to do this by filtering the data for what we're looking for and making sure all points are accounted for. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One conclusion based on launch date is that plays launched in the early spring or summer are more likely to be successful. Another conclusion based on launch date it that there are far fewer kickstarters launched in December, so this may be a good time to launch a project as there is simply less competition for individuals seeking to contribute to the arts. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Our conclusion based on goals can be that a funding amount should be either less than $20,000 or between $35,000 and $40,000 as these are the ranges in which the percentage of successes are greater than the percentage of failures. 


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This data set has many limitations. Firstly, we have a limited number of observations and are only interested in the observations pertaining to the theater sub-category. Another limitation is that we have no insight into more sentimental aspects; perhaps Louise's choice of play, Fever, is simply not that beloved within the broader theater community. Perhaps if we had a standardized way of evaluating the cultural popularity of a particular piece of theater some further insights into likelihood of funding could be established. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Some other possible tables or graphs which would probably be interesting would be in the universe of backer-relationships. Are kickstarters with large numbers of backers more likely to be successful? What is the relationship between average contribution per backer and outcome? These could guide a kickstarter regarding the importance of comunity outreach in achieving the funding goal.
